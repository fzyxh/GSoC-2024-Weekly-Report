## Coding Plan

Week 4-6 (Plan):

-   Finish Issue [#68](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/texor/issues/68): Make an optional param for autonumbering equations without `\nonumber`

Week 4-5 (Real):

-   Finish .rnw -\> .rmd workflow and test
-   Finish Issue [#68](https://github.com/Abhi-1U/texor/issues/68): Make an optional param for autonumbering equations without `\nonumber`. It's related to current work on .rnw -\> .rmd workflow.

## What have been done (Committed)

-   Fixed the bug that cannot correctly convert abstract in some cases.
-   Added support for self-defined macros in rnw_to_rmd workflow.
-   Fixed some math syntax that cannot be correctly shown in R Markdown or HTML.
-   Added support for multiple yaml metadata in rnw_to_rmd workflow.

## What have been done (Committed) {.smaller}

-   Fixed Number, label and cite equations in R Markdown.
    -   `\label` is only supported in `bookdown::html_document2`, not in `rmarkdown::html_vignette`.
    -   Fortunately, Christophe's solution may help.

<br>

-   To keep HTML file size small and make use of the feature in `bookdown::html_document2` format at the same time, we may use following output options as default:

    ``` yaml
    output: 
      bookdown::html_document2:
        base_format: rmarkdown::html_vignette
        number_sections: true
    ```

## What have been done (Committed) {.smaller}

-   Preserve bib file and reference in R Markdown.
    -   Reference format should be considered
    -   Style can be changed with Citation Style Language (`.csl` file), but different styles in one document are not supported.
    - Cannot detect all fields when converting reference to BibTeX format.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
setwd("C:\\Users\\phinney\\Desktop\\GSoC2024\\GSoC-2024-Weekly-Report\\week4-5")
cat('<div style="display: flex;">')
cat('<img src="./1.png" alt="filter1" style="width: 50%;"/>')
cat('<img src="./2.png" alt="filter2" style="width: 50%;height: 50%"/>')
cat('</div>')
```

## What have been done (Committed)

-   Bibliography can have different cite styles in Rnw file, like `\citep{}` and `\citet{}`. But R Markdown only supports the same style, although author is optional.

<br>

-   For example in R Markdown:

    ``` markdown
    Cite here[@koen:ng:2003]. Another try without authors[-@koen:ng:2003].
    ```

    will be converted to:

    ``` markdown
    Cite here(Koenker and Ng 2003). Another try without authors(2003).
    ```

## What have been done (Committed)

-   But in R Markdown, we cannot cite with different styles in the same document like LaTeX. For example:

    ``` latex
    Cite here\citet{koen:ng:2003}. Another try\citep{koen:ng:2003}.
    ```

    will be converted to:

    ``` latex
    Cite here Koenker and Ng (2003). Another try (Koenker and Ng, 2003).
    ```
    
## Problems to solve out

- Some LaTeX commands befor `\begin{document}` should be move to wrapper file or be deleted.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./3.png" style="width: 40%;height: 40%" />
</p>

## Next to do

-   Handle the problem of LaTeX commands before `\begin{document}`.
-   Create a test example file to cover most part of the workflow.
-   Write Documents for functions.
-   Create first PR for `Abhi-1U/texor`.
-   Deal with Issue #68.

# Thank you!
